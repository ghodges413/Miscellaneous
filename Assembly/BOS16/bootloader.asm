;   The bootloader is loaded from a very specific part of memory
;
;   Compile this file with the command:
;       nasm.exe bootloader.asm -f bin -o bootloader.bin
;       nasm.exe kernel.asm -f bin -o kernel.bin
;
;   Concatenate multiple files together with the copy command:
;       copy /b bootloader.bin+kernel.bin bos16.bin
;
;   Run the binary in bochs x86 emulator by loading the bochsrc.bxrc file
;
;   To run from usb stick use the command:
;       dd if=c:\my files\boot.bin of=\\.\z: bs=512 count=1
;   to ensure the copy to usb will put the file at the right address.
